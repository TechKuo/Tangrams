7a)  times_inverse  
     any input besides 1 then would violate this property
     
     because integer division floors any quotient so when you multiply say 2 
     and its inverse according to integer division, you would get 0 which is != to 1

b)  non_negative_times
    max_int 2
     
    max_int * 2 -> -2 even though max_int and 2 are non_neg 

c)  transitive 
    .000001 .000002 .000003
    
    since equality for floats is defined as within 10^-6, the first two values will
    be equal and the last two will be as well but the first and the third will not.

d)  Because you have to check equality on your numbers multiple times when you are
    calculating the Minkowski Difference during your tangrams games, it would be a
    horrible idea to use real numbers since their equality function may never terminate.
